in port declarations:
we declare array/vectors as [size] signal_name.
But in assignments or in the body of the module we declare a array/vector as signal_name[size]

It is also very important that in the port declaration, if there are arrays of different sizes they are supposed to be declared separately!
Incorrect way:
input [3:0]a, [1:0] b, c,d,
Correct way:
input [3:0]
