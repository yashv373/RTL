# RTL

A growing collection of **RTL designs and testbenches** written in **Verilog** and **SystemVerilog**.  
This repository serves as my personal practice log and reference library as I work through digital design problems and subsystem implementations.

## Contents
- Track 1: **HDLBits solutions** (Verilog + SystemVerilog)
- Track 2: **Digital circuits library** (from textbooks & online resources)
- Track 3: EWSkills
- Track 4: ChipDev.io
- Track 5: QuickSilicon

## Goals
- Strengthen RTL design skills through structured practice  
- Explore multiple coding styles (behavioral, structural, synthesizable)  
- Build a reusable library of tested digital blocks  
- Document learning and verification practices
